Hello! I am an undergraduate student at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/) (Class of 2027) pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering.

My fascination with Probability and Statistics, sparkled by [Professor Shanmuga](https://shanmuga.people.iitgn.ac.in/)'s class during my second semester led me to delve deeper into Machine Learning. I am interested in Computer Vision. I've previously worked at the [Sustainability Lab](https://sustainability-lab.github.io/) under [Professor Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/) on Vision Language Models for Object Detection in Satellite Imagery.

Similarly, my fascination with Systems and Networks ignited by [Professor Sameer G. Kulkarni](https://sameergk.github.io/)'s Computer Networks course as well as [Professor Abhishek Bichhawat](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~abhishek/)'s Operating Systems course led me to work on AI-Native Network Diagnostics at [DoT 5G Use Case Lab](https://www.bharat5glabs.gov.in/main) as well as contributing to [Rust Embedded](https://github.com/rust-embedded)'s OS Tutorials on the Raspberry Pi!

Outside of academics, I love relaxing through reading, running and gaming.

When I need a break, I love getting lost in sci-fi movies, especially the work of Christopher Nolan. Music is also a constant companion; you can find me listening to a variety of genres. Here are some of my absolute favorites:
